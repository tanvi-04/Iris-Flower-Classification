# Overview:
<br>
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The classification is performed using a linear regression model.
<br>
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is "Iris.csv" containing information about the Iris flower species. It includes the following columns:
<br>
SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal in centimeters
SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal in centimeters
PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal in centimeters
PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal in centimeters
Species: Species of Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)
<br>
Steps Involved:
<br>
Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Basic exploratory data analysis techniques such as head(), tail(), shape, isnull().sum(), and info() are used to understand the structure and contents of the data.
<br>
Data Preprocessing: The 'Id' column is dropped as it does not contribute to the analysis. Additionally, the species names are mapped to numerical labels for ease of modeling.
<br>
Data Visualization: Boxplots are used to visualize the distribution of each feature. A heatmap is plotted to visualize the correlation between different features.
<br>
Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from Scikit-learn. A linear regression model is then trained on the training data.
<br>
Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error metric. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is also calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model.
